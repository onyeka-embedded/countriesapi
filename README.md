# CountriesApi App

## App description
Country app is mobile application for searching about 250 countries, 
and their capitals with details about the countries; details like :
- population
- area size
- Timezones
- Currencies etc.

User can search for a country by scrolling to the desired country and
by clicking on any country the detail page will be shown.

User can as well search for any desired country by using the search bar,
sort the country by by continent etc

## Code description
The code was structured using MVC pattern. The project has a model
that helps to map out the json response received from the API.
It also has a screen üìÅ that contains the main app screen and the detail screen,
finally, the provider folder that contains two dart files for managing light/dark mode
and the overall app state management.

## Library used
- Screenutil: I used Screenutil package to make the app responsive
- Swiper: 
- Provider: for state management

## Challenges faced and how it was solved
- Receiving data through the API: I solved the problem with the help of other interns and stack overflow

## Future features
