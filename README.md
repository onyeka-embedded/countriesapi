## Code description
The code was structured using MVC pattern. The project has a model
that helps to map out the json response received from the API.
It also has a screen üìÅ that contains the main app screen and the detail screen,
finally, the provider folder that contains two dart files for managing light/dark mode
and the overall app state management.
